<!-- 
    The DTD file determines two things :

    (1) What kind of element (i.e. tag names and attributes) are valid
    (2) How the valid elements relate to one another (e.g. parent-child)
-->

<!-- 
    Every XML document must stem from a root element, in this case the element "page".
    In the element declaration, we can also define which elements go directly inside (i.e. the "children").
    In this case the root element "page" expects three child elements : (1) header, (2) main, (3) footer

-->
<!ELEMENT page (header, main, footer)>

<!--
    Every element that appears in the DTD must be explicitly defined.
    In this case, we must define the three children "header", "main" and "footer", which stem from the "page" element
    To keep this example as simple as possible, we will not define other elements inside the first-level children.
-->

<!-- Define the header element, which will accept some content using the #PCDATA notation -->
<!ELEMENT header (#PCDATA)>

<!-- Define the main element, which will accept some content using the #PCDATA notation -->
<!ELEMENT main (#PCDATA)>

<!-- Define the footer element, which will accept some content using the #PCDATA notation -->
<!ELEMENT footer (#PCDATA)>
