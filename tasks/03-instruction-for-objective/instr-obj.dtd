<!--
    We define a simple DTD that indicates an objective and the instructions to reach it.
    The instruction can be either ordered (sequence) or unordered (list)
-->

<!-- We define a root objective that can contain one or more single objective -->
<!ELEMENT objectives (objective+)>

<!-- The objective contains a title, a description and either a sequence or a list -->
<!ELEMENT objective (title, description, (sequence | list))>

<!-- The title contains only text -->
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>

<!-- The description contains only text -->
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>

<!-- A sequence contains one or more instructions -->
<!ELEMENT sequence (instruction+)>

<!-- Also a list contains one more more instructions -->
<!ELEMENT list (instruction+)>

<!-- We must define the instruction element, NOTE THAT IT MUST BE DEFINED ONLY ONCE -->
<!ELEMENT instruction (#PCDATA)>
